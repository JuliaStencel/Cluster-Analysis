# Documents Similarity based on Cluster Analysis

This project focuses on document clustering, a practical field used in various domains such as business and science for tasks like document organization, similarity detection, and search optimization. The aim of this project is to design and implement various clustering algorithms and compare results.

The dataset is a collection of news articles from different categories, and the algorithms are evaluated using external metrics like purity, entropy, homogeneity, and completeness. Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, TF-IDF, dimension reduction, and selecting the number of clusters are discussed as essential steps before clustering. The project presents comparisons of partitioning, hierarchical, density-based, model-based, and graph-based, clustering methods.
